html:
- list-of-users.html:
    - find a way to display role as well. currently it only displays array, maybe ask pete?
- remember to change page titles so they correspond to what page you are on
- Navbar is collapsed on mobile, fix
- Navbar doesnt scroll with page, fix
- for help see bulma documentation

use this for GO BACK buttons
<form th:action="@{/}" method="get">
    <button class="button is-primary" type="Submit">Go To XXX Page</button>
</form>

Spring security:
- redirect user to admin page if admin, else to user page

admin stuff:
 - EVERYTHING ADMIN RELATED MUST BE PUT IN ADMIN FOLDER BECAUSE OF PRIVILEGES

list-of-users.html:
- find a way to display role as well. currently it only displays array, maybe ask pete?

everything else:
 evt contact me m. messagesystem, som blir gemt i databasen og kan vises i webapp i sin egen menu?
 evt add h2 support?
