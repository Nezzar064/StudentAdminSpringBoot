//Format: TODO + PRIORITY/NUMBER

Maybe add a forgot password function or something??


IMPORT STUFF INTO SPRING BOOT
START FROM CLONING LOGIN TEMPLATE
- figure out to redirect to admin menu if admin
- otherwise redirect to secretary menu
- passwords are already encrypted
-

StudentService:
- remember IDCHECKER for DELETING A STUDENT!!
    - or use spring studentRepository? idk use the idchecker i guess
- put stuff from studentadmin/studentservice.java here

StudentController
- endpoints must be studentadministration/ENDPOINT HERE
- import stuff from studentoutput etc, otherwise put it in studentservice or make
    a studentoutput class as well...

html:
- Home.html
- Registration.html
- Login.html
- navbar styling?
    - add each page to its corresponding menu:
        - Administration
        - Viewer
        - Changer
        - Admin
            - delete users, add users, show users
- admin/home.html
- addStudent.html
- deleteStudent.html
- one html for each studentOutput, put in its own folder
- do all the annoying CSS work
- remember to change page titles so they correspond to what page you are on
- maybe add fragment for head with viewport, navbar.css and container-row.css?

add SECRETARY to roles.mysql script

admin stuff:
 - EVERYTHING ADMIN RELATED MUST BE PUT IN ADMIN FOLDER BECAUSE OF PRIVILEGES
 - implement saveAdminUser
    - change ADMIN to USER in saveUser AFTER redoing sql script to have USER as well.
 - Could try to hide admin menu if user isnt admin, if following link doesnt work, then research:
