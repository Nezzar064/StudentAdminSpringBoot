Maybe add a forgot password function or something??


IMPORT STUFF INTO SPRING BOOT
START FROM CLONING LOGIN TEMPLATE
- figure out to redirect to admin menu if admin
- otherwise redirect to secretary menu
- passwords are already encrypted
-

StudentService:
- remember IDCHECKER for DELETING A STUDENT!!
    - or use spring studentRepository? idk use the idchecker i guess
- put stuff from studentadmin/studentservice.java here

StudentController
- endpoints must be studentadministration/ENDPOINT HERE
- import stuff from studentoutput etc, otherwise put it in studentservice or make
    a studentoutput class as well...
- help to controller: https://github.com/yashmahes/Student-Management-System-Java-Spring-MVC-Project/blob/master/Students%20Management%20System/src/main/java/com/ci6110/ci6110/controllers/StudentController.java

html:
- Home.html
- Registration.html
- Login.html
- navbar styling?
    - add each page to its corresponding menu:
        - Administration
        - Viewer
        - Changer
        - Admin
            - delete users, add users, show users
- admin/home.html
- addStudent.html
- deleteStudent.html
- one html for each studentOutput, put in its own folder
- do all the annoying CSS work
- remember to change page titles so they correspond to what page you are on
- maybe add fragment for head with viewport, navbar.css and container-row.css?
- 404 error page, error.html
- Navbar is collapsed on mobile, fix
- Navbar doesnt scroll with page, fix

Spring security:
- figure out how to implement that logout actually works...

add USER to roles.mysql script

admin stuff:
 - EVERYTHING ADMIN RELATED MUST BE PUT IN ADMIN FOLDER BECAUSE OF PRIVILEGES
 - implement saveAdminUser
    - change ADMIN to USER in saveUser AFTER redoing sql script to have USER as well.
 - Could try to hide admin menu if user isnt admin, if following link doesnt work, then research:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42409310/how-to-make-menu-tab-invisible-if-the-user-is-not-admin
 - CHANGE ACTIVE STATUS FOR USER

everything else:
 evt contact me m. messagesystem, som blir gemt i databasen og kan vises i webapp i sin egen menu?
 evt add h2 support?
